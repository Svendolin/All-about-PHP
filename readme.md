# &nbsp; - ALL ABOUT PHP - ✔

This "All about PHP"-repository catches up its focus on all the PHP I've learned, commented and written through the years as a **SAE-Web Development** student with exercise lessons every week as well as tutorial videos on _Youtube_.         
Direct Link to the place where I'm studying are you going to find [HERE](https://www.sae.edu/che/de?utm_source=PS01&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-4SLBhCVARIsACrhWLVIaD_aUt7y4brT7tqMW9o7tskgb1vjQqJFkzQwkwdN_40_Ls7MgAEaAtXxEALw_wcB)

 XAMPP:
* Use XAMPP Windows Systems. Its a local web-server (stack) for your local ideas and projects. [DOWNLOAD XAMPP HERE](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html)
* Use MAMP if you're working on a MAC: [DOWNLOAD MAMP HERE](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/)
* Use WAMP if you want to work with another stack: [DOWNLOAD WAMP HERE](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)

USEFUL STEPS:

1. Download and Save. Open xampp-control.exe
2. Start Apache and MySQL
3. Empty htdocs for the very first use. This will be your index
4. Adjust XAMPP control panel for the very first use as well:
5. Apache > Config > php.ini > change to I) display_error: on AND II) error_reporting: E_ALL
6. Navigate through the files via htdocs and open it via Visual Studio Code to work with
7. Visit your work in your browser. Lifeserver doesnt work, so write "localhost" in your URL of your browser instead
