# &nbsp; - ALL ABOUT PHP - âœ”

This "All about PHP"-repository catches up its focus on all the PHP I've learned, commented and written through the years as a **SAE-Web Development** student with exercise lessons every week as well as tutorial videos on _Youtube_.         
Direct Link to the place where I'm studying are you going to find [HERE](https://www.sae.edu/che/de?utm_source=PS01&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-4SLBhCVARIsACrhWLVIaD_aUt7y4brT7tqMW9o7tskgb1vjQqJFkzQwkwdN_40_Ls7MgAEaAtXxEALw_wcB)

## Technologies and Installization âœ…
***
PHP:
* PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely used and general-purpose open source scripting language that is specifically suited for web programming and can be embedded in HTML.  [GET MORE DETAILS HERE](https://www.php.net/manual/de/intro-whatis.php)

* Are you new to PHP? Check out the  [PHP DOCUMENTATION HERE](https://www.php.net/docs.php)
<br />
<br />

 XAMPP - INSTALLIZATION:
* Use XAMPP Windows Systems. Its a local web-server (stack) for your local ideas and projects. [DOWNLOAD XAMPP HERE](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html)
* Use MAMP if you're working on a MAC: [DOWNLOAD MAMP HERE](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/)
* Use WAMP if you want to work with another stack: [DOWNLOAD WAMP HERE](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
<br />
<br />

XAMPP - USEFUL STEPS:

1. Download and open xampp-control.exe
2. Start Apache and MySQL
3. Empty htdocs for the very first use. This will be your index
4. Adjust XAMPP control panel for the very first use as well:
   * Apache > Config > php.ini > Change to: 
   * I) display_error: on 
   * II) error_reporting: E_ALL
6. Navigate through the files via htdocs and open it via Visual Studio Code to work with
7. Visit your work in your browser. Lifeserver doesnt work, so write "localhost" in your URL of your browser instead

<br />
<br />
MyPHPAdmin - CREATE DATABASES:

1. Open MyPhpAdmin within your URL window: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/` . Now you can create and structurize databases!
2. "Databases" > "Create New Database" (give server a command where to fetch data) > "select default charset" > "utf8-unicode-ci" > "Create"
3. "Import" > "Select File" (format will change to SQL if the data ending is .sql too) 
     * The file path is shown above (...)>(...)>(...)
     * Path overview for selections is also displayed on the left in a tree diagram
     * TIP: Use "right klick" on the desired subpage in the navigation on the left and open in new tab to work faster and cleaner
4. "Create Table" > Select name column with appropriate labels for your project
5. A_I (AUTO INCREMENT) = "Incrementing itself" > Click on the first field of "IDcomment" = It becomes Primary (it receives a PRIMARY KEY)
6. Add the suitable DATATYPES:
   * VARCHAR is variable character limit. You should enter this, e.g. maximum 100 characters for the name
   * TEXT = Write a lot of text without restriction.
   * BOOLEAN = True or False as confirmation
   * INT = data capability (length) of the ID. Be on the safe side with INT: If the character capacity is exceeded, there is no room for any further saving data
   * TINYINT = (1 byte, 255 integer data) vs BIGINT (8 byte, Billions of integer data #)
   * TIMESTAMP = as well as the default with "current_time": Display the current time on every save.
The "default" is an additional possibility to influence the default value (e.g. as defined: 0 = false)
* IMPORTANT: there are exact number data types that use integer data:
To save space in the database, use the smallest data type that can reliably contain all possible values. 
For example, TINYINT would suffice for the age of a person, since no one can live more than 255 years. 
However, tinyint would not suffice for the age of a building, since a building can be more than 255 years old.

MyPHPAdmin - EXPORT DATABASES:

7. "Export" > (Export selected pieces) as a Backup for safety > "OK"
